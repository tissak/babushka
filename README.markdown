> Deploy time! I'll just add a vhost. Oh, and a unix user, and copy the config from that other app. Or was it a different one? Oh well, that worked. Wait, why can't I log in from my testing box? I'm sure I added that SSH key. And where is that shell alias? Oh crap, I only added that on dev the other day. Ohh, I can log in if I chmod 700 my .ssh dir. Why the 500s? Oh lol, forgot to add a new DB user.

Deploying a webapp or setting up a new user account or configuring automated backups aren't hard. They're made up of lots of simple little jobs that have to be done just right.


if only it were this easy (hint: it is)

how is dep formed?
---

A dep (dependency) is something that you want to do, like add a user account, or build a webserver, or install a gem. Deps depend on other deps.

Each dep is really small and simple. A little nugget of code that does one thing and does it right. They're deliberately as concise as possible, so you can quickly write one and then never do its job manually again.

Example: to get a rails app running..

    dep 'rails app' do
      requires 'gems installed', 'vhost enabled', 'webserver running', 'migrated db'
    end

... there are four requirements (maybe more, for your app - just tack them on). Each one depends on a few other things, and so on. So `vhost enabled` from above:

    dep 'vhost enabled' do
      requires 'vhost configured'
      met? { File.exists? "#{vhosts}/on/#{domain}.conf" }
      meet { sudo "ln -sf '#{vhosts}/#{domain}.conf' '#{vhosts}/on/#{domain}.conf'" }
      after { restart_webserver }
    end

Any dep can depend on any number of other ones. A given dep can be required by multiple others and it all comes out in the wash. If you accidentally a loop, Babushka will let you know. So you don't have to think about the heirachy, just each little piece on its own.

This isn't only about deploying webapps though. Deps like to do anything that you don't.

    dep 'user setup' do
      requires 'user shell setup', 'passwordless ssh logins', 'public key', 'vim'
    end

    dep 'passwordless ssh logins' do
      requires 'user exists'
      met? { grep var(:your_ssh_public_key), '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' }
      meet {
        shell 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh'
        append_to_file var(:your_ssh_public_key).end_with("\n"), "~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
        shell 'chmod 700 ~/.ssh'
        shell 'chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
      }
    end

Don't worry about the `your_ssh_public_key` var - Babushka will ask for it when it needs the value.

So in general:

    dep 'something you want to do' do
      requires 'something else', 'and another dependency', 'like this one'
      met? {
        # is this dependency already met?
      }
      meet {
        # this code gets run if it isn't.
      }
    end


what are there deps for?
---

Pretty much whatever I've needed. That means that there are lots missing, and the ones there are may well not be right for you.

But a dep is so easy to write or modify, you can do up a quick one for just about anything and pop it in `~/.babushka/deps`. Send me the good ones and I'll include 'em!


n.b.
---

Babushka is new, in flux, and only has partial test coverage. Also, many deps will change your system irreversibly, which is kind of the whole point, but it has to be said anyway. Use caution and always have a backup.
